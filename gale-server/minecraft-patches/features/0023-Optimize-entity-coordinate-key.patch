"Optimize entity coordinate key"

* Pufferfish description *

When executing getCoordinateKey for entities (a hotpath), the JVM is
required to repeatedly cast doubles to longs. The performance impact of
this depends on the CPU architecture, but generally switching between
FPU and ALU incurs a significant performance hit. The casted/rounded
data is already available in the blockPosition struct, so we use that
instead of re-doing the casting.
