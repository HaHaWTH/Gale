* Velocity description *

Inspired by the approach described at the bottom of https://richardstartin.github.io/posts/dont-use-protobuf-for-telemetry

Given that we do a lot of varint writing as well, this should provide a small performance boost for larger/complex packets whilst not regressing hard on smaller packets.

This includes a test to ensure that the behavior is as expected and fixes the initialization loop so that the correct results will be given. Much thanks to @octylFractal for acting as my duck while trying to figure this out.
